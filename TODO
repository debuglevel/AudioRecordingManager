- change (de)compression to be based on single files instead of the whole data directory
-- on compress:
-- only compress changed .au files (compare mdate) (or those which have no matching .au.bz2 files)
-- delete unchanged .au files (and keep existing .au.bz2 files)
-- delete .au.bz2 files which have no matching .au file
